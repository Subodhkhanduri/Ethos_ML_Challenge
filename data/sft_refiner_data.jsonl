For Alice's statement to hold true, the discounted bill must also be divisible by 3, because it is an amount that each would pay if they split it. Alice's part after adding the tip (1/3 of the discounted bill) is essentially the discounted total. Every dollar in the discounted total represents $3 in the original bill. Since Alice refuses to use coins, the discounted bill is a whole dollar amount that is a multiple of 3. Let's start from a reasonable amount for a meal for three and work our way up: $24 (adding the tip makes it $32, not divisible by 3), $27 (adding the tip makes it $36, which is divisible by 3). If the discounted bill was $27, each person would contribute $9. Consequently, the original bill would be $27 + $9 = $36 in total, which is not correct since Alice would have said she paid less than the original bill. Moving up, the discounted bill totaling $36 (where each person pays $12) would lead to an original $36 + $12 = $48, and so on.

Since Alice's individual payment must be a whole number, let's try the next multiple of 3, which would be $27 (which is also divisible by 3). The discounted bill would then equal $81 and the original bill $81 + $27 = $108, which is not divisible by 3.

The work rate for each machine is the reciprocal of the time it requires to finish the task (1/time). Machine A's rate is 1/2, Machine B's 1/4, Machine C's 1/6, and Machine D's 1/8. You combine the rates of two machines to find the best pair:\n\n- A + B = 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4\n- A + C = 1/2 + 1/6 = 2/3\n- A + D = 1/2 + 1/8 = 5/8\n- B + C = 1/4 + 1/6 = 5/12\n- B + D = 1/4 + 1/8 = 3/8\n- C + D = 1/6 + 1/8 = 7/24\n\nThe highest combined rate is when Machines A and B work together (3/4). This means they will finish the task in 4/3 hours, or 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is faster than any other combination. Therefore, operating Machine A and Machine B simultaneously will minimize the total time."}

However, the corners are counted thrice and the edges are counted twice. Therefore, we need to subtract the corner contributions.

Since there are 8 corners, these account for 1 unit of volume which we need to subtract once as they are over-counted twice, once for each of the three adjoining strips. Next, we deduct half the volume of each small edge cube (which has a volume of 1 unit) since they are counted in two adjoining strips along the face, giving us 12 half units to subtract.

Each side of the solid cube must be a multiple of the cube edge to allow for perfect alignment. Since the longest block is three times as long as the cube edge, the side length of the solid cube must at least be three times the unit cube. Thus, the smallest solid cube will have sides that are three unit cubes long (3x3x3 cube). This equals 27 unit cubes of volume. The most efficient way to fill this volume would be to use the larger blocks. You would need 3 blocks of the 'three times longer' blocks and 3 blocks of the 'twice as long' blocks to create two layers of the 3x3x3 cube (3x3=9, twice for two layers is 18 and three 'three times longer' blocks fill up 9 unit cubes). Then you can fill the last layer with 9 unit cubes. This sums up to 3(three times longer blocks) + 3(twice as long blocks) + 9(unit cubes) = 15 blocks in total."}

Machine B would produce 40 gadgets in 60 minutes, Machine C would produce 30 gadgets in 60 minutes, and Machine D would produce 24 gadgets in 60 minutes. If all the machines work together for 60 minutes, they will produce 60 (A) + 40 (B) + 30 (C) + 24 (D) = 154 gadgets which is more than required. To optimize, we can calculate how many gadgets each machine produces every half minute: A = 0.5, B = 1/3, C = 1/4, D = 1/5 gadgets every half minute. Since Machine A is the fastest, let it run for the entire time, while we switch off the other machines as soon as the target of 60 gadgets is reached.
